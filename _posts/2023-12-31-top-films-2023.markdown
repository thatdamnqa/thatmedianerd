## 1. Barbie

All. The. Pink.

## 2. Wonka

Don't let the trailer cloud your judgement on this one, and try not to overthink how this fits in with the wider Chocolate Factory story. It's
still a fun film

## 3. Elemental

Classic Pixar storytelling

## 4. M3GAN

A fine performance from Amie Donald as M3gan

## 5. STILL: A Michael J Fox Movie

A honest account from a man trying not to let Parkinson's slow him down

## Honorable Mentions

1. Are you there God? It's Me, Margaret
2. Missing
